/**
 * A receiver of broker status changes. Objects which need to
 * receive broker status changes must implement this interface,
 * as well as register themselves with a client via {@link
 * Client#addBrokerStatusListener(BrokerStatusListener)}.
 *
 * <p>It's expected that listeners will take a short time to return
 * because all listeners are invoked sequentially.  If a listener
 * takes too much time to process a status change, it will delay the
 * status delivery to other registered listeners.</p>
